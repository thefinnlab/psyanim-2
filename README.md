# Psyanim 2.0

## Introduction and Overview

See instructions below for building & running Psyanim 2.0.<br><br>
Keyboard controls are also shown on main web page.

## Getting started:

**0. Install Node.js with npm: `https://nodejs.org/en/download`**

**1. Install dependencies with: `npm i`**

**2. To run local dev server and open client in browser: `npm start`**

**3. To watch for code changes while dev server is running, in a separate terminal run: `npm run watch`**

**4. To build with webpack for deployment: `npm run build`**

## Keyboard Controls:

**Use keys 'j' and 'k' to change scenes.**

**For scenes with a player controller, use WASD for movement.**

**Some scenes have a mouse follow target, so moving mouse will affect agents.**

**Press 't' key to toggle physics time scale (can slow down / speed up simulation for debugging).**
